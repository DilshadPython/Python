## Numerical Python: is a library consisting of multidimersional array object and collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NP mathematical and logical operation on arrays can be performed. Also NP can be replacement of Matlab.
NP will be used often with SciPy and Matplotib Library this combination is widely used as a replacment of rMatlab
The goal of NumPy is to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
