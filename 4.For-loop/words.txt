## What is Encapsulation?


## What are the built-in type does python provides?
### Mutable Type:
#### List[]
#### Stes([])
#### Dictionary {}

### Immutable Types
#### Tuple()
#### Strings
#### Numbers

### What is lambda?
#### A lambda is a single expression known as anonymous function used inline function.

### Why lambda forms python does not have statments?
#### Because lambda used to make new function object and retern the them at runtime.

### What are Iterators?
#### Iterators used to iterate a goupe of elements, container like List.

### What is slicing?
#### It's a mechanism to select a range of item from sequence types like list, tuple, strings.

### What is the different between xrange and range?
#### xrange return an object while range return a list, it doesn't matter how big the range size.

### What are Python decorators?
#### A Python decorator is a specific change that we make in Python syntax to alter functions easily.

### What is pickling and unpickling?
#### Pickle module accept any Python object and convert into a string and dumps it into a file using dump function, this is called pickling. While the process of retrieving orgiginal Python objects from the stored string is called unpickling.

### What are generators in Python?
#### The way of implementing iterators are known as generators.  It is a normal function except that it yields expression in the function.

### In Python 2 if we divid 9/2 return 4
Python 2.7.15+ (default, Jul  9 2019, 16:51:35) 
[GCC 7.4.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 9/2
4
### Where in Python 3 you have always float return 
Python 3.6.8 (default, May  7 2019, 14:58:50) 
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 9/2
4.5
>>> 12 / 3
4.0
>>> 
### Input in python3 the output is string not an number, but it's different in pyhthon2
