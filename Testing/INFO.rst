# Benchmarking with TimeIt

- Benchmarking, means comparing two code snippets to see which is executes faster. 
- Time and memory are often not a concern to use, but it is to some Python Programmers.
- Time tests should be run multiple times
- Tests should consider the context in which they will run.
- Benchmarking is something of an art.
