The relationships betwwen Class Attribute and Instance Attribute
1. Attributes/Variables in the class are accessible through the instance object created
	of the current class has been define
2. Instance Attribute as well accessible by the instance object
3. When we use syntax object.attribute, we're asking python to look up the attribute
	- First in the instance
	- Then in the class
4. Method calls through the instance follow this lookup
