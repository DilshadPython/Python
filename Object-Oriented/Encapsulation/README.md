Encapsulation:

Encapsulation: The first of the three pillars of OOP
Encapsulation refers to the safe storage of data (as attributes)

Data should be accesses only through instance methods
Data should be validated as correct (depending on the requirements set in class methods)
Data should be safe from changes by external processes.

- Although normally set in a setter method, instance attribute values can be set anywhere
- Encapsulation in Python is a voluntary restriction 
- Python does not implement data hiding, as does another languages
