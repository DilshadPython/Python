Muultiple Inheritance

- Class can inherit from multiple classes
- Python use the 'depth-first' oder when start searching inheriting classes
- If two class inherit from the same class
    - python eliminates the first mention of that class from the mor (method resolution order)
- The above applies to 'new style' classes (inheriting from object)
