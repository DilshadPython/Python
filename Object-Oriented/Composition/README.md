# Composition vs inheritance

## Inheritace can be brittle [a change may require changed elsewhere]

## Decoupled code is classes, functions, etc that work independently and don't depend on one another

## As long as the interface is maintained, interaction between classes will work

## Not checking or requiring practicular types is polymorphic and Pythonic.
